#Oh-my-vim

Vim is an application that I need to use everyday and I have had to
spend quite some time making it work exactly the way I want it to.  It
is nothing short of a God to me (hence the name).


##Usage:
To install this vim setup, run:

```shell
make install
```

If you have edited your own setup, then once within this directory,
run:

```shell
make update
```
